We'll be hosting another Hacknight about Pixelated, LEAP, and all things crypto. The free internet needs you! This is for you, whether you're interested in crypto, and/or want to have a cold one with like-minded people, and/or want to get your hands on a privacy-related project.

We intend to have a couple of (moderated) sessions around different subjects to better group interests and achieve a more rewarding experience for everybody. Possible sessions might include, but not limited to:
* How does encryption work? What are the basics about encryption? Why is it a good thing?
* How do I contribute to open source communities?
* I know security UX and want to bounce some ideas around, what to I do?
* I have an organization and want to provide an email solution, what do I do?
* I have Python/JS/HTML/CSS/Ruby/Puppet/... expertise, where can I help?
* How do I set up a LEAP/Pixelated platform?

These session will be gathered and voted on at the meetup. We're looking forward to your suggestions and learning what you're interested to work on.

A part of the Pixelated team will join us. For those going hands-on-the-code, we'll give an overview of the architecture before we start hacking. You don't need to be proficient in JavaScript or Python to join, the sessions will be highly interactive with people ready to help. We will of course help you set up the Pixelated development environment on your machine and help you wherever help is needed. We will set up a running test provider for the hacknight.


## Side notes

* Please note there's a [Code of Conduct](/faq/#code-of-conduct). In short: Be excellent to each other :) 


## Preparation

If you plan to go hands-on-the-code, it's highly recommended that you bring your own laptop. If you cannot bring a laptop, we will encourage you to pair with someone who has brought theirs. In order to get started easily, we will work on a virtual machine enviromnet (via vagrant). This contains all the dependencies for the project. Please have the most recent versions of the following software installed:

* If you use a Mac, please consider having [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed to make things easier.
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [libvirt](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/details/development#using-vagrant-with-libvirtkvm).
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html­).
* An editor that can handle HTML, Javascript and Python. We recommend PyCharm, Atom, Sublime, or Vim.

You'll find the most up-to-date information in [this pad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/hacknighthh).

We will provide updates related to setup as needed before the event!

If you haven't contributed to an open source project on Github before, don't worry/despair. We're friendly people :)
