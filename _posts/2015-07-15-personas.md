Aiming for mass adoption makes targetting specific types of users hard. Plus, being such a widely used kind of application, figuring out what email users are like is a hard enough task - add encryption on top of that and the complexity gets way bigger.

In order to try to solve that, we've interviewed dozens of people while trying to map what personas could represent our users. The idea is to always have them in mind when we're designing features, user interface elements and looking for people to perform user testing with to validate what we're doing.

Here's the result.

Sally is a hacktvist. She's technologist, an activist and open-source contributor, so she's the kind of people who will help Pixelated and also talk about the project to other people. 

Being tech savvy, her needs differ a lot from most users - for instance, she might care more about having keyboard shortcuts than color themes.


![Paul Productive](/assets/images/posts/persona_paul.png)

Paul's not a technologist, but he cares about privacy and is not afraid to try new technologies. This can represent any professional who would want to try Pixelated - maybe not contribute to its code or troubleshoot setup issues, but play with the system and even provide constructive feedback.

Olivia is probably the most common type of user; she uses email mostly as a professional mean of communication and, in most cases, uses whatever provider or client her organization provides. She's not tech savvy, doesn't care as much about privacy and wants to be able to quickly learn whatever tools she needs to use. For those reasons, if encryption is too complicated for her, she'd simply not use it - so she needs a painless crypto experience :)

Tina is an IT infrastructure person; she wouldn't necessarily code, but she would be concerned about setting the server up, keeping it up and performing well and being able to easily solve her users needs - uptime crucial and she can't afford to provide support to everyone that might need.

Clive's a college student. He always had an email account that he mostly used as he's online ID, so he could sign up for other services. Email is just too formal for him, so he uses it to communicate with his professors and possible employers only - but he occasionally sends himself the papers he's writting for college.

Informal communication with friends and family? Facebook messenger, whatsapp, SMS, etc..

As everything in a lean, open-source work, these are mutable and don't intend to cover every single type of user we might have... so, if you have feedbacks or ideas, please [let us know](/#contact).
