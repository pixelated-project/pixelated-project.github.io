Between July 8th and 11th, the Pixelated team attended the [FISL 16](http://softwarelivre.org/fisl16) conference. We have been present at the communities area and were able to do lots of activities, including a few talks about Pixelated, privacy, mass surveillance and open-source.

It was a great opportunity to get to know people, present Pixelated and start contributing relationships. Here are some of the pictures:
