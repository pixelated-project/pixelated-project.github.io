We are excited to announce that we have 3 hacknights comming:
* [World: June 29th] (http://www.meetup.com/cryptohack/events/231390595 )
* [Hamburg, Germany: June 29th] (http://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Hamburg/events/231933541 )
* [São Paulo, Brazil: July, 5th] (http://www.meetup.com/conexaotwsp/events/232056198/ )

In Hamburg, the hacknight will be in the Thoughtworks office, in Brazil it will be in a Hacker Space and the Australian one is virtual.
Each one will have a specific format but all of them will be related to the Pixelated Project.

Feel free to join in, you're welcome in whichever one works better for you! :) 

The free internet needs you! 
This is for you, whether you’re interested in crypto, and/or want to have a cold one with like-minded people, and/or want to get your hands on a privacy-related project.

A part of the Pixelated team will join us. 
For those going hands-on-the-code, you don’t need to be proficient in JavaScript or Python to join, the sessions will be highly interactive with people ready to help. We will of course help you set up the Pixelated development environment on your machine and help you wherever help is needed. 

In order to get started easily, we will work on a virtual machine enviromnet (via vagrant). 
This contains all the dependencies for the project. Please have the most recent versions of the following software installed:
If you use a Mac, please consider having [homebrew] (http://brew.sh/ ) installed to make things easier.
[Virtual Box] (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads ) or [libvirt] (https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/details/development#using-vagrant-with-libvirtkvm ).
[Vagrant] (https://www.vagrantup.com/ ).
An editor that can handle HTML, Javascript and Python. We recommend PyCharm, Atom, Sublime, or Vim.

If you haven’t contributed to an open source project on Github before, don’t worry/despair. We’re friendly people :) 
Here’s [a guide to contributing to open source on GitHub]. (https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/ )

Please note there’s a [Code of Conduct](https://pixelated-project.org/faq/#code-of-conduct). 
In short: Be excellent to each other :)
