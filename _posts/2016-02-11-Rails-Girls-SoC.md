The LEAP webapp got accepted to this year's [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/). In this context, the Pixelated Project will work with LEAP on the webapp. [Varac](https://github.com/varac) from Pixelated and [Azul](https://github.com/azul) will be mentoring the program, and there will be a team of coaches setup by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/).

[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) aims to foster diversity in Open Source. Its goal is to get people started, learning and staying excited about coding! Selected teams receive a three-month scholarship to work on Open Source projects of their choice.

[Application](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/82) as a team starts at February 15th. [Here’s LEAP’s project application](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/82), including a list of features that could be worked on. We're already excited to have you with us! Should you have any questions about the application, feel free to contact either the [Pixelated Team](https://pixelated-project.org/faq/#contact-the-project) or the [LEAP Project](https://leap.se/en/about-us/contact).
