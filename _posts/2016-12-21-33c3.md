Yey! We are so excited, everything is tidy and clean for the Congress - our Brazilian team members already took their "winter" clothes off the closet :D 

Pixelated has been testing with real users for the past months and we have a lot usability insights to share with the community.

"Let’s break this vicious circle. 

Let’s get together and live our utopia.

Let’s strive for something that works for all of us.

And let’s fight those, who will not let us!"
