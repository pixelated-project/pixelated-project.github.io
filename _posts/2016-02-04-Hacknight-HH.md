Hooray, the Pixelated Team is doing another Hacknight session! If you want to get involved with a privacy-related project, this is for you.

We will help you set up the Pixelated development environment on your machine and help you to work on a couple of features of the web client (aka the user-agent). We will set up a running test provider for the workshop.

A part of the Pixelated team will join us and give an overview of the architecture before we will go into coding. You don't need to be proficient in javascript or Python to join, the session will be highly interactive with people ready to help.

A few exciting things we're working on at this hack night:

* Setup your own secure mail provider using the Pixelated Platform
* Connect to a secure mail provider through a self-hosted web client


## Side notes

* Doors open on February 15 2016 at 18:00. We aim to have everything wrapped up by 22:00. We will provide food and beverages.
* Venue is the ThoughtWorks office at Großer Burstah 46, 20457 Hamburg
* Even though you can certainly also take part without registering for the event, registering [here](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/pixelatedleap-hacknight-easy-to-use-encrypted-email-with-decentralized-hosting-tickets-21338472947) or [via email](mailto:team@pixelated-project.org) would help us to organize a sane amount of snacks and drinks.
* It's highly recommended that you bring your own laptop. If you cannot bring a laptop, we will encourage you to pair with someone who has brought theirs.


## Preparation

In order to get started easily, we will work on a virtual machine enviromnet (via vagrant). This contains all the dependencies for the project.

Please have the most recent versions of the following software installed:

* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [libvirt](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/details/development#using-vagrant-with-libvirtkvm).
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html­).
* An editor that can handle HTML, Javascript and Python. We recommend PyCharm, Atom, or vim.
* If you use a Mac, please consider having [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed to make things easier.

You'll find the most up-to-date information in [this pad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/hacknighthh).

We will provide updates related to setup as needed before the event!
