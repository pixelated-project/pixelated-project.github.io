<h3>What - Easy to use encrypted email with decentralized hosting</h3>

<p>Pixelated makes email encryption simple. While encryption tools can be cumbersome and difficult to learn, Pixelated offers a seamless user experience, a practical response to mass surveillance and an alternative to current centralized email applications.</p>

<p>Email is the most popular internet application, with billions of users sending billions of messages each day. Initially designed to have a decentralized protocol, “free” email services offered by giant corporations have centralized almost half of the world’s email content and metadata in one country, making it subject to the laws and surveillance habits of that country.</p>

<p>Pixelated is a software distribution that will make it easier than ever before for organisations to implement a secure email solution, with a user-friendly interface that individuals will be able to intuitively understand. It offers end-to-end encryption, free and open source, without the software installation requirements and keys that often confuse individuals in order to encourage the mass adoption that will make mass surveillance more difficult and expensive.</p>

<p>Not only can you use this email solution, but you can examine the code and you can help improve it over time.</p>

<section id="why" class="guide-section about-section" name="why">
<h3>Why - Encryption should be accessible to everyone with email to protect our right to privacy against mass surveillance</h3>

<p>While many suspected, Snowden's revelations have confirmed that entire populations are under dragnet surveillance, compromising our rights to privacy, freedom of association and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Encryption makes good business sense - protecting client and customer data is necessary for guaranteeing safe financial transactions.  Confidentiality between lawyer and clients, doctors and patients, journalists and sources, priests and confessors are all recognised as essential for those institutions to function.  Without confidentiality, the notion of "innocent before proven guilty" becomes redundant and the idea of a free press is over.</p>

<p>Encrypting our communications is not hiding, suspicious or a crime. Resisting the chilling effects of mass surveillance helps to restore rights, protect colleagues and fundamental principles upon which democracy rests in the digital age.</p>

<h3>Who - Technologists, businesses & organisations protecting personal & financial data</h3>

<p>Pixelated is for everyone!</p>

<p>Everyone concerned about mass surveillance wanting a practical alternative solution</p>

<p>Everyone wanting privacy and protected professional communications.<br> 
 Everyone in an organisation or business protecting member and client data.<br>
 Everyone not afraid to experiment with new tools and improved solutions.<br>
Everyone who doesn’t have technical expertise about encryption tools.<br>
Everyone who cares about open source software that can be verified and improved.<br>
Everyone who manages servers and administers systems for organisations.</p>

<p>To significantly counter mass surveillance, Pixelated, along with compatible solutions and derivatives, needs mass adoption. Therefore the target user is anyone who wants to use
web-based email. The target users do not have to have a special interest in privacy or mass surveillance. Pixelated seeks to make protecting the privacy of email communications as convenient as possible. </p>

<h3>When - Demo available now, volunteers welcome!</h3>

<p>Pixelated is an open source software and development is happening in public. At this point, the software works and it is possible to write and read encrypted emails. A demonstration installation is available at [https://try.pixelated-project.org:8080](https://try.pixelated-project.org:8080).</p>

<p>If you’d like to help develop the project for daily use, <a href="/getting-started">see how to get started</a>.</p>
