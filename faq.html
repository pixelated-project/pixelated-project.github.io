    <h2 id="what-is-pixelated-and-what-problems-does-it-address">What is Pixelated and what problems does it address?</h2>
    <p>Pixelated is a software distribution that gives organizations to means host their own modern privacy-preserving email solution. Even in a time of social networks, video and instant messaging, email is a staple of our digital lives. It is still vital to the way Internet users shop, share and work.</p>
    <p>Email communication is subject to mass dragnet surveillance. The reason dragnet surveillance exists is because it is so cheap easy to do, and all of the data is bundled up in just a few places. Having access to a handful of the major email providers will give you plain text access to most of the email conversations in your country, already readable and searchable. Most organization currently use proprietary SaaS solutions like Gmail or Outlook.com, which puts a handful of providers in a market-dominating position and bundles all of the data in one place [REPHRASE].</p>
    <p>Both problems can be solved with decentralization and encryption. If we can achieve widespread use of secure email it will be too costly and economically unreasonable to routinely intercept the majority of email on the internet. This does not mean that a motivated adversary will not be able to intercept specifically targeted communication, but it should end mass surveillance on the scale we have to endure today. When widespread encryption is not the norm, those who use it to protect themselves stick out and bring attention to themselves. If, however, widespread use of encryption were the norm, they would just blend in. And that is why Pixelated exists: Decentralizing and encrypting communication puts control over your data in your hands.</p>

    <h1 id="relation-to-thoughtworks-and-leap">Relation to ThoughtWorks and LEAP</h1>

    <h2 id="why-is-thoughtworks-investing-in-pixelated">Why is ThoughtWorks investing in Pixelated?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> is a software company and a community of passionate, purpose-led individuals. We think disruptively to deliver technology to address our clients&#39; toughest challenges, all while seeking to revolutionize the IT industry and create positive social change. We have a history of seeding the development of genre-defining open source software, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CruiseControl">CruiseControl</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29">Selenium</a>.</p>
    <p>Like the projects listed above, Pixelated is not a ThoughtWorks product and we&#39;re not in it for the money [REPHRASE]. We hope to establish a vibrant community around a great project that can thrive on its own. We want to see Pixelated succeed simply because we think it is the right thing to do.</p>

    <h2 id="how-long-will-thoughtworks-keep-investing-in-pixelated">How long will ThoughtWorks keep investing in Pixelated?</h2>
    <p>ThoughtWorks has funded a team (starting in 2014 in Hamburg (GER) and London (UK) and later split between Hamburg (GER), Porto Alegre (BRA), and Recife (BRA) ) to work on Pixelated full-time. The plan is to keep a core team of 8-10 people dedicated to Pixelated throughout 2016 and beyond.</p>
    <p>At the same time, outside contributions and committers are encouraged to join, for example by attending “hack nights” in various cities, and the team hopes that a larger community will form around Pixelated, collaborating on the ambitious task of building a compelling email solution.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-leap">What is LEAP?</h2>
    <p>LEAP is a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. For more details please refer to <a href="https://leap.se/en">LEAP&#39;s project homepage</a>.</p>
    <p>Pixelated is built on the LEAP platform. The Pixelated and LEAP teams are in close contact with each other.</p>

    <h2 id="why-is-pixelated-not-a-thoughtworks-product">Why is Pixelated not a ThoughtWorks product?</h2>
    <p>ThoughtWorks’ role is to support the development of the product and community creation/management. For various reasons, ThoughtWorks will not run a public Pixelated service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Centralisation is a problem; therefore it would defeat the entire project&#39;s purpose to create a centralised (default) Pixelated service.</li>
      <li>ThoughtWorks, Inc. is a US-based company and subject to US jurisdiction. It would face the similar problems that Lavabit faced. Providing email services comes with legal obligations in many jurisdictions. This is complexity ThoughtWorks cannot deal with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can, however, provide support to organisations aspiring to host instances of Pixelated themselves.</p>

    <h1 id="where-do-i-get-it">Where do I get it?</h1>

    <h2 id="who-uses-pixelated">Who uses Pixelated?</h2>
    <p>To significantly counter mass surveillance, Pixelated, along with compatible solutions and derivatives, needs mass adoption. Therefore the target user is anyone who wants to use web-based email. The target users do not have to have a special interest in privacy or mass surveillance. Pixelated should not make privacy a trade-off with convenience. Users should simply want a great web-based email solution, which Pixelated delivers while also offering seamless and effortless use of encryption. In a nutshell: Pixelated is built for those who are not focused on encryption and privacy.</p>

    <h2 id="who-offers-pixelated">Who offers Pixelated?</h2>
    <p>We hope to see widespread deployment of Pixelated at mail providers, ISPs, and hosting providers. We believe this group is crucial to achieve widespread adoption of Pixelated.</p>
    <p>The tech-savvy anti-surveillance-minded individuals are target users and customers at the same time. We have, through structured interviews and casual conversation, understood that users who are tech-savvy without having a clear interest in mass surveillance are, at least at this stage, not excited about Pixelated. This may change once we have delivered a user experience that is appealing in its own right. There is also evidence that an interest in privacy (which can be for very different reasons than being opposed to mass surveillance) does not guarantee an interest in Pixelated. Thus, the focus for now is on those with an interest in preventing mass surveillance.</p>
    <p>The crowdfunding campaign for Mailpile has shown that there is not only demand but also a willingness to support a product in this space. In September 2013 they raised $167k, much more than their $100k goal, from more than 3000 individual backers. These backers are the &quot;tech-savvy, anti-surveillance-minded individuals&quot; we want to target initially, to test our ideas and to bootstrap community building. We have to be careful not to design the product too much for this small group because their needs are not fully representative of our broader target group.</p>
    <p>Some mail providers may consider Pixelated a central service offering for their own customers/users. We believe, however, that most are going to see Pixelated merely as a feature of their own offerings. In this scenario, the compelling user experience of Pixelated combined with its privacy features would provide a competitive advantage for companies in an industry in which players struggle to differentiate themselves from the competition. It is conceivable that there will be a “white-label” version of Pixelated allowing mail providers to customise the user experience to match their own visual identity.</p>

    <h1 id="how-can-i-keep-myself-safe">How can I keep myself safe?</h1>

    <p>If you&#39;re wondering about how to protect your privacy, this is the paragraph you&#39;ll find most interesting. Here, you&#39;ll find everything you want to know about what decisions we made to keep you safe and secure while using your Pixelated provider of choice, and also where the limits are.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-cryptography-and-encryption-and-why-should-i-care">What is cryptography and encryption and why should I care?</h2>
    <p>Cryptography is the science of secret communication, while encryption refers to one component of that science.</p>
    <p>Encryption is a mathematical process to scramble (&quot;encrypt&quot;) data in such a way that only someone with access to a secret key or password can unscramble (&quot;decrypt&quot;) and read it. It is the most effective way to achieve data security known today. Unencrypted data is referred to as <em>plain text</em>, whereas encrypted data is called <em>cipher text</em>.</p>
    <p>For example, if you purchase something from a website, the information for the transaction (such as your address, phone number, and credit card number) is usually encrypted to help keep it safe. Hence, the general rule of thumb is:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Use encryption when you want a strong level of protection for your information. Encryption helps you to safeguard your information from eavesdropping and it allows for tamperproof message exchange.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Applying cryptography to modern communication tools basically allows you to create a safe space for yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can speak privately over open channels and associate with whom you want to associate, while nobody in between is the wiser.</li>
      <li>You can speak publicly, and everybody can make sure that the message relayed to them is authentic and has not been tampered with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Journalism is a good example here. Besides the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the government, journalism is an extra-governmental forcing function in the system of checks and balances. Investigative journalists have the power to rectify deficiencies. Their unique ability is to get insights in otherwise completely walled-off affairs. In order to do this, it is imperative to speak privately to their source.</p>

    <h2 id="encryption-surveillance-and-the-nothing-to-hide-argument">Encryption, surveillance, and the nothing-to-hide argument</h2>
    <p>There is a misconception that no harm will come to you because you are not interesting. Surveillance is a form of behavioral control. You will change your behavior if you know that you are under surveillance.</p>

    <h2 id="is-this-yet-another-nsa-proof-email-encryption-initiative">Is this yet another NSA-proof email encryption initiative?</h2>
    <p>No. Even though Pixelated largely relies on similar technologies as other email-encryption projects, we&#39;re orchestrating them very differently, focused on ease-of-use. As we explained above, Pixelated&#39;s aim is to make <strong>pervasive dragnet surveillance economically unreasonable</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you&#39;re under targeted surveillance by an intelligence service, you will need to deploy extensive security measures to the point where you can detect and avert intrusion by so-called nation-state adversaries, i.e. highly malicious organizations with vast resources and deep knowledge. At this point, using individual solutions while leaving other intrusion paths open will not protect you to the maximum. In this case, Pixelated itself will not protect you to the maximum and we strongly recommend you seek council of experienced IT security experts.</p>
    <p>But: That does not mean you shouldn&#39;t be able to keep yourself safe from other kinds of malicious folks trying to get into your inbox. Read more on our threat model later.</p>

    <h2 id="where-and-how-does-the-crypto-happen-where-is-my-private-key-stored">Where and how does the crypto happen? Where is my private key stored?</h2>
    <p>Disclaimer: <strong>We do crypto on the server</strong>. Many folks out there will tell you that this is bad, and may be truth to it, but in the end it all boils down to what we call a thread model. Let us explain why this is actually a good tradeoff in our case.</p>
    <p>Encryption needs to serve a purpose, otherwise it likely does more harm than good. Motivations for using encryptiond may be end-to-end encrypted communication, or avoid having your credit card or password stolen, or speaking freely in oppressed political regimes, or having means to see when the content you&#39;re seeing has been manipulated.</p>
    <p>In our very specific use-case, it is about email encryption. The tools to encrypt your emails have been around for years. Email is firmly rooted into the character of the web, to the point where it is impossible to replace it in any timely manner. Despite all that, encryption tools have never taken off, because they are hard to use. When you lose a user during the onboarding process, the need for privacy gives way to convenience. They think they might as well send in plain text, because who would be interested in them anyway? And above all, what&#39;s the worst thing that might happen?</p>
    <p>The Pixelated team has made the hard choices surrounding cryptography so you don&#39;t have to. That&#39;s why the encryption and the management of your encyption keys is handled on the server, so you don&#39;t have to concern yourself with it.</p>

    <h2 id="my-friends-say-that-my-private-key-should-stay-on-my-trusted-device-why-do-you-store-it-on-the-server">My friends say that my private key should stay on my trusted device, why do you store it on the server ?</h2>
    <p>If what you&#39;re trying to achieve the highest level of security possible, then your friends are right. But that has been done before, and that approach has not particularly successful so far. We wanted to try a different approach, where we can give you a reasonable amount of privacy, while keeping in mind that you&#39;ll use it like a website.</p>
    <p>In the end, the answer is as always: It depends on who you want to defend against.</p>

    <h2 id="how-much-do-i-need-to-trust-my-pixelated-provider-can-an-attacker-read-my-mails-is-there-a-difference-to-lavabit">How much do I need to trust my pixelated provider? Can an attacker read my mails? Is there a difference to Lavabit?</h2>
    <p>In order to answer this, let&#39;s take a step-by-step look at what happens from the time you log into Pixelated and when an email reaches the server to when you see it in your browser.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you create your Pixelated account for the first time, Pixelated creates an encryption key on your behalf. This encryption key itself is locked with the passphrase you choose.</li>
      <li>When an incoming email reaches the server, it is encrypted with your key (metadata and all) and stored in the server&#39;s database</li>
      <li>When you login to Pixelated, your encryption key is unlocked with the passphrase you supplied.</li>
      <li>When you view the email, it is being decrypted on-the-fly and displayed your browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So now let&#39;s think about what that does and does not protect you against:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your emails are encrypted at rest on the provider&#39;s server. If your provider is being hacked, the attacker can&#39;t get to the contents of your inbox.</li>
      <li>Your emails are sent encrypted, so if somebody listens to traffic on the wire, they&#39;ll not see the content of your email, even though they&#39;ll see who the email is for. This is a flaw of the protocol, not ours. Sorry.</li>
      <li>Your encryption happens on the server, so if an attacker manipulates the server to record everything happening on it, they could see the contents of your inbox. This attack could be conducted mostly by resourceful adversaries like intelligence services
        and other nation-states-level attackers. It is an attack on a much greater time scale, which makes it harder to pull off without being detected, and requires more funds and sophistication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pixelated has similarities to Lavabit&#39;s design and also its shortcomings. In detail here, an email provider has three main adversaries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An administrator with access to the server.</li>
      <li>An attacker who can get access to the server.</li>
      <li>An attacker who can intercept the communication to the server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pixelated shares these vulnerabilities, just like a conventional (unencrypted) email service, despite the use of cryptography. The security is anchored to the user-supplied passphrase. Should the provider stop averting their eyes, the server can log the password a user transmits and get access to their mails.</p>
    <p>So there is a legitimate question: Is it this worth the trouble at all? Yes, it is, for two reasons.</p>
    <p>Reason #1: Just because something does not give you perfect security, doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no value to it. Email is a distributed system. You can still use your Pixelated account to exchange encrypted emails with somebody who uses regular email encryption, e.g. using Apple Mail and PGPTools. In this use case, it greatly lowers the entry barrier to encrypted communication.</p>
    <p>Reason #2: If you don&#39;t <strong>want</strong> to trust the email provider, Pixelated makes it easy to set up your own email service!</p>

    <h2 id="what-about-activists-and-activist-organisations">What about activists and activist organisations?</h2>
    <p>Privacy, mass surveillance, and activism are often considered together. Activists have a need for strong privacy (see <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/05/26/Privacy-Levels">Tim Bray&#39;s article on privacy levels</a>    for a good discussion of strong vs common privacy) but those who have been specifically targeted have needs that go far beyond what is needed to counter mass surveillance. Thus, a solution that can help an activist defend himself/herself against sustained, targeted surveillance is likely to be so involved that it would be unusable for the majority of email users. We do not think it is possible to build a solution that can be widely used as a regular email solution while also providing the features necessary to counter targeted surveillance. Having said that, we are building Pixelated in a way that should allow to derive activist-oriented products from it.</p>

    <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Pixelated community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
    <p>Our open source community strives to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be friendly and patient</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,
        social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
      <li><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
        Remember that we&#39;re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else&#39;s primary language.</li>
      <li><strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal
        attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>
      <li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&#39;t
        acceptable.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our
        community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is
        human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
    <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation</li>
      <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
      <li>Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person&#39;s gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>
      <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop</li>
      <li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>
      <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
      <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
      <li>Stalking or following</li>
      <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
      <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
      <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
      <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
      <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse</li>
      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please keep in mind that this open source community will always prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.</p>
    <h3 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h3>
    <p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>
    <p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.</p>
    <h3 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h3>
    <p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via <a href="mailto:abuse@pixelated-project.org">abuse@pixelated-project.org</a>. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your contact information.</li>
      <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.</li>
      <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
      <li>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Pixelated Dispatcher</li>
      <li>Pixelated User-Agent</li>
      <li>Soledad</li>
      <li>One/Many LEAP instance/-s</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to give you a rough idea how Pixelated works, let&#39;s look at how these components play together.</p>

    <h2 id="pixelated-dispatcher">Pixelated Dispatcher</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/pixelated/pixelated-dispatcher">Repository on Github</a></p>
    <p>Languages: Python, Puppet</p>
    <p>When a user accesses the URL for their Pixelated service, the connection is being accepted by the Dispatcher. The Pixelated Dispatcher is used to host Pixelated as a group email solution for more than one user. In order to keep user data and details separated for each user, each logged-in user on Pixelated uses a different instance of the User-Agent in its own virtual container. To ensure that each user communicates properly and securely with the correct instance of the User-Agent, the Dispatcher routes communication between the User-Agent and the further-back parts of the system. In a nutshell: It allows you to run, manage and restrict access (using a login form) to different instances of the User-Agent.</p>
    <p>The Pixelated Dispatcher is a combination of two daemons: the Proxy and the Manager.</p>
    <p>The Proxy is the user facing part and the service a user accessed when connecting to their Pixelated service. It handles authentication and acts as a proxy for the agents. The intention is for this daemon to give up on all unnecessary privileges as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The Manager is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the user agent instances. It is not accessible from the web, but provides a REST-ful API to create/start/stop/delete agents. It uses docker to isolate the User-Agent&#39;s processes from each other and to provide the necessary runtime environment.</p>

    <h2 id="pixelated-user-agent">Pixelated User-Agent</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/pixelated/pixelated-user-agent">Repository on Github</a></p>
    <p>Languages: Python, Javascript/HTML/CSS</p>
    <p>The User-Agent is the user-facing piece of Pixelated. It consists of a single-page webapp (since users are most accustomed to using webmail as opposed to a locally installed email client) and provides a RESTful API. The User-Agent focuses on high-quality user experience in order to facilitate the use of email encryption. Pixelated uses an opportunistic approach to encryption: it encrypts every email that it can find public keys for. Using the Pixelated User-Agent, the email user does not have to worry about key generation or key management anymore, since it is handled automatically as far as possible. The User-Agent is the mail client of the Pixelated ecosystem. It is composed of two parts, a web interface written in JavaScript (FlightJS) and a Python API that interacts with a LEAP Provider, the e-mail platform that Pixelated is built on.</p>

    <h2 id="pixelated-puppet-module">Pixelated Puppet Module</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/pixelated/puppet-pixelated">Repository on Github</a></p>
    <p>Languages: Puppet, Ruby</p>
    <p>This puppet module provides a simple way to add Pixelated to a running LEAP Platform. It sets up the <a href="https://github.com/pixelated/pixelated-dispatcher">Pixelated Dispatcher</a> and a multi-user instance of the <a href="https://github.com/pixelated/pixelated-user-agent">Pixelated User-Agent</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="soledad">Soledad</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/leapcode/soledad">Repository on Github</a></p>
    <p>Soledad (Synchronization of Locally Encrypted Documents Among Devices) is a server daemon and client library that allows applications to securely share a common state among devices. Any data saved to the database by the application is client-encrypted, backed up in the cloud, and synchronized among a user’s devices.</p>

    <h2 id="one-many-leap-instance-s">One/Many LEAP instance/-s</h2>
    <p>In a Pixelated server-side setup, the provider is running the Pixelated Platform, which includes a LEAP single node installation and the Pixelated dispatcher that spins up instances of the user agent on every user log-in. LEAP ensures that all data is encrypted at rest, including your meta data, and communicates with other email providers via SMTP/TLS.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-the-underlying-technical-threat-models">What are the underlying technical threat models?</h2>
    <p>When we designed Pixelated, we had the following attacks in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-time attacks on the network (e.g. man-in-the-middle attacks)</li>
      <li>One-time attacks on the server (e.g. hard drive data dump)</li>
      <li>One-time attacks on the client (e.g. XSS attacks)</li>
      <li>Persistent attacks on the client (e.g. compromised computer)</li>
      <li>Persistent attacks on the server (e.g. rootkit)</li>
      <li>Advanced persistent threat on the client</li>
      <li>Advanced persistent threat on the server</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>: Pixelated user sends an email to somebody at a different mail provider. The recipient does not have a PGP key and their mail provider does not support TLS</p>
    <p>We are assuming interception without knowledge of the sender or recipient and/or uncooperative senders and recipients. Attacks marked with one or more exclamation marks are easy to carry out and are within reach of most governments as well as employes of companies providing internet services. Attacks marked “NSA” require serious effort and technical capabilities only within reach of sophisticated attackers.</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Scenario 3</strong>: Like scenario 1 but the recipient has a PGP key. This is the base scenario for any solution using encrypted email with PGP</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Web browser handles metadata and content as clear text.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Message content is encrypted with recipient’s key. Meta data is in the clear. Transport is not secured.</li>
      <li>Message content cannot be accessed. Network access sufficient to get access to the metadata. [!!]</li>

      <li>Message content cannot be accessed. Provider can be compelled to provide access to metadata. [!]</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Scenario 4</strong>: Combination of scenario 2 and 3, ie. TLS and PGP. This is the safest scenario supported by Pixelated.</p>
    <p>Pixelated user&#39;s desktop:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web browser handles metadata and content as clear text.</li>
      <li>Computer must be hacked to get access to the message. [NSA]</li>
